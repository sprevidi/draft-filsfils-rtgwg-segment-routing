    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling
      paradigms. A node steers a packet through a controlled set of
      instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with an SR
      header. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or
      service-based. A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node or
      global within an SR domain. SR allows to enforce a flow through any
      topological path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state only
      at the ingress node to the SR domain.</t>

      <t>The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS
      dataplane with no change on the forwarding plane. It requires minor
      extension to the existing link-state routing protocols. Segment Routing
      can also be applied to IPv6 with a new type of routing extension
      header.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In this section, we illustrate the key properties of the SR
      architecture, introduce the companion documents to this note and relate
      SR to the MPLS and IPv6 architectures.</t>

      <t><xref target="ABSTRACTMODEL"></xref> defines the SR abstract routing
      model. <xref target="IGPSEGMENTS"></xref> defines the IGP-based
      segments. <xref target="SRVCSSEGMENTS"></xref> defines the Service
      Segments. <xref target="MPLS"></xref> and <xref target="IPV6"></xref>
      define the instantiations of SR in MPLS and IPv6.</t>

      <section title="Illustration">
        <t>In the context of <xref target="SRPROPS"></xref> where all the
        links have the same IGP cost, let us assume that a packet P enters the
        SR domain at an ingress edge router I and that the operator requests
        the following requirements for packet P:<list style="hanging">
            <t>The local service S offered by node B must be applied to packet
            P.</t>

            <t>The links AB and CE cannot be used to transport the packet
            P.</t>

            <t>Any node N along the journey of the packet should be able to
            determine where the packet P entered the SR domain and where it
            will exit. The intermediate node should be able to determine the
            paths from the ingress edge router to itself, and from itsef to
            the egress edge router.</t>

            <t>Per-flow State for packet P should only be created at the
            ingress edge router.</t>

            <t>State for packet P can only be created at the ingress edge
            router.</t>

            <t>The operator can forbid, for security reasons, anyone outside
            the operator domain to exploit its intra-domain SR
            capabilities.</t>

        <t>The SR header contains a source route encoded as a list of segments
        {SD, SB, SS, SF, SE}, a pointer (Ptr) and the identification of the
        ingress and egress SR edge routers (segments SI and SE).</t>

        <t>A segment is a 32-bit identification either for a topological
        instruction or a service instruction. A segment can either be global
        or local. The instruction associated with a global segment is
        recognized and executed by any SR-capable node in the domain. The
        instruction associated with a local segment is only supported by the
        specific node that originates it.</t>

        <t>Let us assume some ISIS/OSPF extensions to define a &ldquo;Node
        Segment&rdquo; as a global instruction within the IGP domain to
        forward a packet along the shortest path to the specified node. Let us
        further assume that within the SR domain illustrated in Figure 1,
        segments SI, SD, SB, SE and SF respectively identify IGP node segments
        to I, D, B, E and F.</t>

        <t>Let us assume that node B identifies its local service S with local
        segment SS.</t>

        <t>With all of this in mind, let us describe the journey of the packet
        P.</t>

        <t>The packet P reaches the ingress SR edge router. I pushes the SR
        header illustrated in Figure 2 and sets the pointer to the first
        segment of the list (SD).</t>

        <t>SD is an instruction recognized by all the nodes in the SR domain
        which causes the packet to be forwarded along the shortest path to
        D.</t>

        <t>Once at D, the pointer is incremented and the next segment is
        executed (SB).</t>

        <t>SB is an instruction recognized by all the nodes in the SR domain
        which causes the packet to be forwarded along the shortest path to
        B.</t>

        <t>Once at B, the pointer is incremented and the next segment is
        executed (SS).</t>

        <t>SS is an instruction only recognized by node B which causes the
        packet to receive service S.</t>

        <t>Once the service applied, the next segment is executed (SF) which
        causes the packet to be forwarded along the shortest path to F.</t>

        <t>Once at F, the pointer is incremented and the next segment is
        executed (SE).</t>

        <t>SE is an instruction recognized by all the nodes in the SR domain
        which causes the packet to be forwarded along the shortest path to
        E.</t>

        <t>E then removes the SR header and the packet continues its journey
        outside the SR domain.</t>

        <t>All of the requirements are met.</t>

        <t>First, the packet P has not used links AB and CE: the shortest-path
        from I to D is I-A-D, the shortest-path from D to B is D-B, the
        shortest-path from B to F is B-C-F and the shortest-path from F to E
        is F-E, hence the packet path through the SR domain is I-A-D-B-C-F-E
        and the links AB and CE have been avoided.</t>

        <t>Second, the service S supported by B has been applied on packet
        P.</t>

        <t>Third, any node along the packet path is able to identify the
        service and topological journey of the packet within the SR domain.
        For example, node C receives the packet illustrated in <xref
        target="SRHEADER2"></xref> and hence is able to infer where the packet
        entered the SR domain (SI), how it got up to itself {SD, SB, SS, SE},
        where it will exit the SR domain (SE) and how it will do so {SF,
        SE}.</t>

+---------------------------------------------------------------+</artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Fourth, only node I maintains per-flow state for packet P. The
        entire program of topological and service instructions to be executed
        by the SR domain on packet P is encoded by the ingress edge router I
        in the SR header in the form of a list of segments where each segment
        identifies a specific instruction. No further per-flow state is
        required along the packet path. The per-flow state is in the SR header
        and travels with the packet. Intermediate nodes only hold states
        related to the IGP global node segments and the local IGP adjacency
        segments. These segments are not per-flow specific and hence scale
        very well. Typically, an intermediate node would maintain in the order
        of 100&rsquo;s to 1000&rsquo;s global node segments and in the order
        of 10&rsquo;s to 100 of local adjacency segments. Typically the SR IGP
        forwarding table is expected to be much less than 10000 entries.</t>

        <t>Fifth, the SR header is inserted at the entrance to the domain and
        removed at the exit of the operator domain. For security reasons, the
        operator can forbid anyone outside its domain to use its intra-domain
        SR capability.</t>

        <t>The source routing model is inherited from the one proposed by
        <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The notion of abstract segment identifier which can represent any
        instruction is inherited from MPLS (<xref
        target="RFC3031"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Deployment experiences has shown the need to limit the number of
        per-flow states maintained in the network while preserving information
        on the topological and service journey of a packet (e.g. the ingress
        to the domain for accounting/billing purpose).</t>

        <t>The main differences from the IPv6 source route model are:<list
            style="hanging">
            <t>The source route is encoded as an ordered list of segments
            instead of IP addresses.</t>

            <t>A segment can represent any instruction either a service or a
            topological path. Topologically, the path to an IP address is
            often limited to the shortest-path to that address. A segment can
            represent any path (e.g. an adjacency segment forces a packet to a
            nexthop through a specific adjacency even if the shortest-path to
            the next-hop does not use that adjacency).</t>

            <t>The ingress and egress egde routers are identified and always
            available, allowing for interesting accounting and policy
            applications.</t>

            <t>The source route functionality cannot be controlled from
            outside the SR domain.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The main differences from the MPLS model are:<list style="hanging">
            <t>Global segments are introduced (e.g. IGP node segments).</t>

            <t>LDP and RSVP MPLS signaling protocols are not required. If
            present, SR can coexist and interwork with LDP and RSVP.<xref

        <t>SR can be instantiated on the IPv6 dataplane. <xref

        carry all the elements of the abstract SR header. All the SR
        properties are preserved.</t>

        <t>SR can be instantiated on the MPLS dataplane. In <xref
        target="MPLS"></xref>, we explain that the information present in the
        SR abstract header is encoded as a stack of labels. The notion of
        pointer and full segment list containing the full history of the path
        from ingress to egress edge routers is thus lost in the MPLS
        instantiation of SR. However all the other SR properties are preserved
        and especially the MPLS dataplane can be reused without any
        change.</t>

    <section anchor="ABSTRACTMODEL" title="Abstract Routing Model">
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling
      paradigms.</t>

      <t>At the entrance of the SR domain, the ingress SR edge router pushes
      the SR header on top of the packet. At the exit of the SR domain, the
      egress SR edge router removes the SR header.</t>

      <t>The SR header contains an ordered list of segments, a pointer
      identifying the next segment to process and the identifications of the
      ingress and egress SR edge routers on the path of this packet. The
      pointer identifies the segment that MUST be used by the receiving router
      to process the packet. This segment is called the active segment.</t>

      <t>A property of the architecture is that the entire source route of the
      packet, including the identity of the ingress and egress edge routers is
      always available with the packet. This allows for interesting accounting
      and service applications.</t>

      <t>We define three SR-header operations: <list style="hanging">
          <t>&ldquo;PUSH&rdquo;: an SR header is pushed on an IP packet, or
          additional segments are added at the head of the segment list. The
          pointer is moved to the first entry of the added segments.</t>

          <t>&ldquo;NEXT&rdquo;: the active segment is completed, the pointer
          is moved to the next segment in the list.</t>

          <t>&ldquo;CONTINUE&rdquo;: the active segment is not completed, the
          pointer is left unchanged.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In the future, other SR-header management operations may be
      defined.</t>

      <t>As the packet travels through the SR domain, the pointer is
      incremented through the ordered list of segments and the source route
      encoded by the SR ingress edge node is executed.</t>

      <t>A node processes an incoming packet according to the instruction
      associated with the active segment.</t>

      <t>Any instruction might be associated with a segment: for example, an
      intra or inter-domain topological strict or loose forwarding
      instruction, a service instruction, etc.</t>

      <t>At minimum, a segment instruction must define two elements: the
      identity of the next-hop to forward the packet to (this could be the
      same node or a context within the node) and which SR-header management
      operation to execute.</t>

      <t>Each segment is known in the network through a Segment Identifier
      (SID), a value allocated from the 32-bit Segment IDentifier space. The
      first 16 values are reserved. The terms &ldquo;segment&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;SID&rdquo; are interchangeable.</t>

      <t>Within an SR domain, all the SR-capable nodes are configured with the
      Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB). The SRGB is a subset of the 32-bit
      SID space. SRGB can be a non-contiguous set of segments.</t>

      <t>All global segments must be allocated from the SRGB. Any SR capable
      node MUST be able to process any global segment advertised by any other
      node within the SR domain.</t>

      <t>Any segment outside the SRGB has a local significance and is called a
      &ldquo;local segment&rdquo;. An SR-capable node MUST be able to process
      the local segments it originates. An SR-capable node MUST NOT support
      the instruction associated with a local segment originated by a remote
      node.</t>

      <section anchor="SRTE" title="Traffic Engineering with SR">
        <t>An SR Traffic Engineering policy is composed of two elements: a
        flow classification and a segment-list to prepend on the packets of
        the flow.</t>

        <t>In the SR architecture, this per-flow state only exists at the
        ingress egde router whether the policy is defined and the SR header is
        pushed.</t>

        <t>It is outside the scope of the document to define the process that
        leads to the instantiation at a node N of an SR Traffic Engineering
        policy.</t>

      <t>Within a link-state IGP domain, an SR-capable IGP node advertises

          <t>An IGP-Prefix Segment is an IGP segment attached to an IGP
          prefix. An IGP-Prefix Segment is always global within the SR/IGP
          domain and identifies the ECMP-aware shortest-path computed by the
          IGP to the related prefix. The G-Flag MUST be set. The Prefix-SID is
          the SID of the IGP-Prefix Segment.</t>

          <t>A packet injected anywhere within the SR/IGP domain with an
          active Prefix-SID will be forwarded along the shortest-path to that
          prefix.</t>

          <t>The IGP signaling extension for IGP-Prefix segment includes the
          P-Flag. A Node N advertising a Prefix-SID SID-R for its attached
          prefix R resets the P-Flag to allow its connected neighbors to
          perform the NEXT operation while processing SID-R. This behavior is
          equivalent to Pen-ultimate Hop Popping in MPLS. When set, the
          neighbors of N must perform the CONTINUE operation while processing
          SID-R.</t>

          <t>While the architecture allows to attach a local segment to an IGP
          prefix, we specifically assume that when the terms &ldquo;IGP-Prefix
          Segment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prefix-SID&rdquo; are used then the
          segment is global (the SID is allocated from the SRGB). This is
          consistent with <xref

        <t>Nodes C and I will apply the same behavior when leaking prefixes

        I.</t>

        <t>It therefore results that a Prefix-SID remains attached to its

      <t>SR offers an interesting capability to monitor SR domains:<list
          style="hanging">
          <t>Any path can be monitored by setting the segment list
          accordingly.</t>

          <t>A path can be expressed with ECMP-awareness or not.</t>

          <t>The probe travels along the desired path while staying at the
          forwarding level.</t>

          <t>A monitoring system is able to check any element of the entire SR
          domain, even if it located multiple hops away.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some elements of the SR/OAM functionality will require
      standardization and a related independent draft will eventually be
      submitted.</t>

      <t>SR/OAM use-cases are described in <xref
      target="draft-filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-use-cases-00"></xref>.</t>
